# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Ben

I'm a Computer Science student at UMass Amherst interested in full-stack development, systems engineering, and automation.  
Currently interning at a startup where I build features across a React Native + Django stack, and learning how to ship clean, scalable code that actually gets used.
