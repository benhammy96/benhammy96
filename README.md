# Hi, I'm Ben!

Iâ€™m a junior Computer Science student at UMass Amherst interested in full-stack development, systems engineering, and automation. I previously interned at a pre-seed startup, where I built features across a React Native + Django stack and learned how to ship clean, scalable code that real users rely on.
